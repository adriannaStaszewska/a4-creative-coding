For this assignment I created 3 different visualizations for Nobel Prize Laureates dataset:
- simple bar that shows the percentage of male and female laureates between the start of Nodel Prizes and a given year

- a scatter plot with ages of laureates when they received the prize, which allows the user to sort by prize category as well as highlight female laureates. When a user hovers over a data point, the name of the laureate is shown.

- a map plot that shows countries of birth of the laureates in a given year. User can choose the year as well as hover over the country to get information who got the nobel prize and for what

I struggled the most with implementing the map, espacially the hover. Another challenging part was finding meaningful points of interaction.
